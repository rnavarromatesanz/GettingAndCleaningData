==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we 
captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into 
two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled 
in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, 
which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body 
acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a 
filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating 
variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

INPUT FILES
===========
This are the input files used to the current project


- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
  Its range is from 1 to 30. This values are numerical in order to protect the personal data.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
	This is table with 561 columns that identify every sample.
	
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
	This file encloses the information about the activity, the content are numbers so this values will be updeted 
	during the project to provide a descriptive name, the match between this code and the activity name ias indicated 
	in the file 'activity_labels.txt' that will be explained later.

- 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. 
  Its range is from 1 to 30. This values are numerical in order to protect the personal data.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
	This is table with 561 columns that identify every sample

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name. The values within the column values will be 
	used to match with y_train.txt and y_test.txt
	the column value i
	VALUE  	|	ACTIVITY
	----------------------------
	1 	|	WALKING
	2 	|	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	3 	|	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	4 	|	SITTING
	5 	|	STANDING
	6 	|	LAYING



OUTPUT FILES OR DATA FRAMES
===========================
This are the output data frames or files generatedinput files used to the current project

- 'MergedValues' This is the dataFrame that stores the information unified from the previous files, the content 
hasn't been updated, the unique operation has been the merge
	The estructure of this Data Frame can be understood as the join of each file in an specific 
	position in the final dataFrame

		subject_train	| 	y_train	|	x_train
		-----------------------------------------------
		subject_test	|	y_test	|	x_test
	
	Then the y_train and y_test are updeted in order to change the number that defines the activity for the activity 
	name.
	
		subject_train	| 	Activity_name	|	x_train
		--------------------------------------------------------
		subject_test	|	Activity_name	|	x_test
	
-'meanValues' This arry store the information about the mean obtained from the 561 measures or attributes

-'StandardDesviation' This arry store the information about the Standard Desviationn obtained from the 561 measures 
or attributes

-'meanValues' This Data Frame group the information by user and activity, and later a mean is calculated by each 
group. The structure is really similar to the Data Frame Merged Values, although in this case the atributes has 
been used to calculate the mean.
	
		subject_train	| 	Activity_name	|	mean(x_train)
		--------------------------------------------------------
		subject_test	|	Activity_name	|	mean(x_test)
